I'm happy you're here! Lebanon is happy you're here.

Thank you for visiting my simple site, because there should be nothing complex about being an active community member. 

## The Face Behind the Words

My name is Grace, and I'm a proud resident of Lebanon's West Cornwall. Best 17 years of my life!! Currently, I'm a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame studying American Studies and Film, Television, and Theatre. After leaving Pennsylvania for Indiana almost two years ago, I had two realizations. 

> Lebanon, PA is pretty darn awesome. While I was still a Pennsylvania phanatic when I lived within its borders full time, living just about 600 miles away from my home really cemented my passion for the state, and Lebanon. Time makes the heart grow fonder, or so they say. 

> Giving back to Lebanon becomes a very deliberate choice after high school graduation. In high school, it seemed almost easy to fall into the groove of service clubs and organizations that do an annual donation or volunteer day. After graduating high school and leaving behind Key Club, it seemed like I my service to Lebanon had suddenly been cut off. Following my freshman year of college, I returned to Lebanon for the summer and quickly immersed myself in service to the Wolf Sanctuary of PA, and seemingly finding my groove again.

Returning to Notre Dame for my sophomore year, the impact of service and my love for Lebanon stayed strong. After learning about the history of comuputing and coding skills in my spring semester course "Code in Context," I decided to create Loving Lebanon as my final project for the course.

# Goals

So, what is Loving Lebanon doing here? Loving Lebanon, which is basically just a compilation of resources, was designed with three hopes in mind:

1. Encourage residents to volunteer their time with a local organization they are passionate about.
2. Help residents make connections with their neighbors to make getting involved in a new hobby or pursueing an old passion more joyous.
3. Connect residents with local giving societies that align with their interests.

## Enhancing Community

I believe that living somewhere should be about more than simply being a resident. To live in Lebanon should undoubtedly be to know, serve, and love Lebanon. Through volunteering, shared spaces, and donation, I believe we can enhance commmunity in Lebanon, reminding us all to find the good in ourselves to love and support our neighbors.
