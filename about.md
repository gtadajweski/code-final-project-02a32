I'm happy you're here! Lebanon is happy you're here.

Thank you for visiting my simple site, because there should be nothing complex about being an active community member. 

## The Face Behind the Words

My name is Grace, and I'm a proud resident of Lebanon's West Cornwall. Best 17 years of my life!! Currently, I'm a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame studying American Studies and Film, Television, and Theatre. After leaving Pennsylvania for Indiana almost two years ago, I had two realizations. 

> Lebanon, PA is pretty darn awesome. While I was still a Pennsylvania phanatic when I lived within its borders full time, living just about 600 miles away from my home really cemented my passion for the state, and Lebanon. Time makes the heart grow fonder, or so they say. 

> Giving back to Lebanon becomes a very deliberate choice after high school graduation. In high school, it seemed almost easy to fall into the groove of service clubs and organizations that do an annual donation or volunteer day. After graduating high school and leaving behind Key Club, it seemed like I my service to Lebanon had suddenly been cut off. Following my freshman year of college, I returned to Lebanon for the summer and quickly immersed myself in service to the Wolf Sanctuary of PA, and seemingly finding my groove again.

Returning to Notre Dame for my sophomore year, the impact of service and my love for Lebanon stayed strong. After learning about the history of comuputing and coding skills in my spring semester course "Code in Context," I decided to create Loving Lebanon as my final project for the course.

# Goals

So, what is Loving Lebanon doing here? Loving Lebanon, which is basically just a compilation of resources, was designed with three hopes in mind:

1. Encourage residents to volunteer their time with a local organization they are passionate about.
2. Help residents make connections with their neighbors to make getting involved in a new hobby or pursueing an old passion more joyous.
3. Connect residents with local giving societies that align with their interests.

## But Why?

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance.

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value.

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 â€“ $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - building
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
  - trademarks
  - patents
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
